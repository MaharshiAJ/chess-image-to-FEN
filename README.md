# Chess Image to FEN

A simple program that returns the corresponding FEN code for a chess position. Underneath, it uses a neural network to read the image and determine the corresponding FEN code. The image generator was inspired by: [Random-FEN-Generator](http://bernd.bplaced.net/fengenerator/fengenerator.html).
